Uniclone

This is a decentralized exchange (DEX) project that is a clone of Uniswap, a popular and widely used DEX built on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized platform for users to trade various tokens in a secure and trustless manner without the need for intermediaries.

Features

* Token Swapping: Users can swap different tokens directly on the platform without needing a traditional order book. The exchange is powered by smart contracts, which automatically match buy and sell orders based on predefined rules.

* Pool Creation : Users have the option to create their own liquidity pools using custom ERC-20 Tokens. 

* Liquidity Provision: Users can also provide liquidity to the platform by depositing tokens into liquidity pools. In return, they receive liquidity tokens that can be used to earn fees generated from trades on the platform.

* Decentralized Governance: The project incorporates a decentralized governance model, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes related to the platform's development and future updates.

* Non-Custodial: As a DEX, this project is non-custodial, meaning users have full control over their funds and private keys. There are no centralized entities holding or managing user funds, providing enhanced security and privacy.
